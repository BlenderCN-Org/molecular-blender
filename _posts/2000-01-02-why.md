# Blender is extremely versatile

Molecular blender is an import plugin specialized for files used in quantum chemistry:

- .xyz (single frame and trajectory)
- .cube (orbitals)
- .molden (orbitals)

## Capabilities

- imports with sensible defaults so the first pass looks good
- materials and properties linked to ease common transformations
- basic styling (stick model, VDW, ball and stick, wireframe)
- support for animations (input as multiframe .xyz files) including dynamically
  drawing bonds
- find and fill in aromatic rings
- draw spheres sitting on atoms to represent atomic charges and dynamically
  scale them during an animation
- draw isosurfaces from volumetric data (.cube) or molecular orbitals (.molden)
