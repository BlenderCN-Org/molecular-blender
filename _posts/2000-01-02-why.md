# Blender is extremely versatile

But existing tools to make molecular images with blender are limited. Molecular blender
is an import plugin specialized for .xyz files of molecules used in, for example,
quantum chemistry.

## Capabilities

- imports using linked objects making rapid changes to the aesthetics feasible
- basic styling (VDW, ball and stick, wireframe)
- support for animations (input as multiframe .xyz files) including dynamically
  drawing bonds
- find and fill in aromatic rings
- draw spheres sitting on atoms to represent atomic charges and dynamically
  scale them during an animation
